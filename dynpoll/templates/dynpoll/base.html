    <p><strong>django-dynpoll</strong> was created while working on a special presentation, that required live polls in the auditorium.</p>

    <p>Usually you would find a collection of badges here, to show-off how well the development was done.</p>
    <p>However, this is a quick'n'dirty rapid prototype thing, so there is no test-coverage, only basic PEP8-compliance and, honestly, I didn't even think about versioning up to now.</p>
    <p>Documentation? Good one, buddy!</p>
    <p>I <strong>might</strong> add some effort to this project, to make it actually nice and shiny. Or at least functional. But I don't think there is a real use-case for this application.</p>
